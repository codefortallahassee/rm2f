## The Seven Tenets

- **Map digital services to community needs**; services & features; local issues; impact-driven.
- **Discover**; best services; make them easy to find where & when citizens need them most.
- **Identify gaps & opportunities**; overlay service/need maps across different regions/locations.
- **Explore**; time travel; map the future onto service/need maps; aim & launch an expedition.
- **From ideas to impact;** adopt-an-app, project starter kits, resource conduits & success indicators.
- **Raise the bar**; create friendly, heathy competition; show don't tell.
- **Reward**; the advancement of digital services that align with local needs; feed the press.
