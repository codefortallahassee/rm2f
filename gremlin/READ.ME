CityData processes/cleans Cities500
and admin2Codes.

GraphDatabase creates our NoSQL database
from the results of CityData.

The Cities500 and admin2Codes data is taken from
[GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/). At the
time of writing, this information cannot be 
downloaded via the REST API, and therefore must
be retrieved manually before running anything.

Will expand at a later date...
